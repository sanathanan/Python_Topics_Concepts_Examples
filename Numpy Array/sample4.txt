"Extract the important entities related to Test case from the attached text file. 1. First extract all function names or features from each user story. 2. Then extract specific TestCase names to cover both functional requirements (positive test cases) and validation for incorrect inputs or error handling (negative test cases). 3. Ensure for each user story, generate at least one positive and one negative test case if applicable. 4. Test Case IDs should be sequential across all test cases, starting from TC001. Do not reset for negative cases. 5. Avoid placing all functional requirements into a single test caseâ€”split logically into multiple test cases. Desired format for each test case: Test Case Id: -||-Test Case Type: -||-Test Case Name: -||-Description: -||-Precondition: -||-Steps: -||-Expected result for each step: -||-Test Data for each step: -||-"
